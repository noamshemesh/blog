While developing for Android I had this feeling that something was missing. In Java, most of the time we use a DAL layer (aka JPA, Hibernate) to access the database, in Android I couldn't find something appropriate.

Therefore, in each project that I was involved in, we found ourselves writing a specific DAL layer, that over time was developed to something that could be used by other projects.

I thought it would be nice to publish it for everyone's use.

The project is hosted by github on [https://github.com/noamshemesh/sqlite-orm](https://github.com/noamshemesh/sqlite-orm "sqlite-orm")

Any comments or suggestions are more than welcome! Please reply here or open an issue in github.

Noam.
